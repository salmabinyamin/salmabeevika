        <h1><center>Web Development</center></h1>
        <p><center>While I don’t think everyone should code (or wants to), web development is a very valuable skill to learn if you’re so inclined.

            Obviously, you can use it to make money through a job or freelancing. But it also makes it much easier to create and market your projects online. And, it can be extremely fun and exciting (especially with new advancements happening each day). Finally, it’s a great way to get into other more technical (but useful) forms of programming.
            
            To start learning web development, I recommend these resources:
            How to Become a Software Developer (According to the Pros) – An interview with two professional software developers with tips on interviews, networking, and building a career once you’ve learned to code.
                Also, if learning to program intimidates you, I encourage you to at least learn the basics of HTML. This can make it much easier to maintain your own website (see the next section for more on that).</center></p>
